	Planarization is the process of taking the graph and creating a flat, planar 2d embedding of the graph.  
	Since any 2d graph can be topologically rearranged so that all vertices are aligned in a single dimension,
	the planarization is an ordering of vertices, a set of faces and an ordering of edges around each vertex.
	
	The planarization algorithm (MGT) has been extended to handle containers and directed edges, where direction
	is expressed as LEFT, RIGHT, UP or DOWN.  
	
	Crossing edges (i.e. edges which cannot be introduced into the maximal planar subgraph without crossing another edge)
	are introduced by splitting the edges are adding crossing vertices.
