	This package contains value objects which can be used in ADL (Abstract Diagram Language).
	</p><p>
	The idea of an abstract diagram is to present a simple collection of items to represent any
	kind of box-arc diagram.  The user is then free to use these for whatever purpose needed.
	</p><p>
	Ideally, the elements provided should make it possible to 'read' the diagram without any
	understanding of what various shapes mean - there is no hidden knowledge required to read the diagram
	(unlike UML).
