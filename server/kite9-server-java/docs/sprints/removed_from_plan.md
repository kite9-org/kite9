# Sprints Removed From The Plan

As we've gone along, various sprints have become unnecessary:


<strike>
### We need to send our object model to JSON.

- This is going to be a lot of JSON.
- It should be about creating groupings, setting paths and setting styles + classes.
- Everything that was in the original object model, plus layout information.

*(Removed 13/4/2016)*

</strike>

<strike>
### Styling

- React should pass through the style tag to the JSON elements for inclusion on the diagram.
- Write a test to make sure this happens.

*(Removed 11/5/2016)*
</strike>

<strike>
### CSS

- Write a Kite9 CSS file, which will be also loaded up by the react component.
- Turn off the style element coming from Kite9:  can we replace this with CSS class?

*(Removed 13/5/06)*
</strike>


<strike>
### Client-Side CSS

- Get React to render the client using the same css file.
- Write some tests for this somehow to check it’s correct.

*(Removed 11/5/2016)*
</strike>


<strike>
### Symbols Using Grid Layout

- Write a test that shows some symbols, each having a class, inheriting their outline shape, colour etc.  and being rendered correctly.

### Glyph Using Grid Layout

- Write a few simple tests to do a grid layout.   We have 3 basic glyph-types that can use this.

### Symbols Using Grid Layout

- Write a test that shows some symbols, each having a class, inheriting their outline shape, colour etc.  and being rendered correctly.

### Layout

- extract this so that there’s a separate class for each different layout.
- Just keep existing tests working.

### Extend CSS

- Add my own elements to the CSS so that I can see these being inherited by various elements.  I want to get to the stage where part layout has some CSS properties associated with it.
- Need to decide what these CSS elements are, but obviously they should be about layouts.

### Grid-Layout Context

- Contexts should have the capacity now to store multiple grids.  There will need to be some clever interpretation here (i.e. we need to construct the grid on-the-fly) but it’s ok.
- This should be a nice example, with a test.
