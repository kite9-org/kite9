# Palette

A palette is a regular kite9 diagram. However, in the SVG rendering, certain attributes are significant:

### `title`

Gives the palette a title on the accordion.

### `icon`

The icon that the palette will have on the accordion

### `allow-drag="true"`

Any elements within this container to be dragged off the palette.
